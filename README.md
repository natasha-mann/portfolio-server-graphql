## About the Project

I built this repo using GraphQl to serve the data needed to compile the project cards for my React portfolio, which you can view [here](https://natasha-mann.github.io/portfolio-react/)

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:natasha-mann/portfolio-server-graphql.git

npm i

npm run start
```

You can also run the server in dev mode with this command:

```
npm run dev
```
